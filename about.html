                        source provisions at reasonable rates for the residents of Hackney Wick and Fish Island.</p>

                            While the primary objective for this project is based around affordable creative workspace, the scope for it’s impact is
                        far wider providing significant research and development to be applied to the area and further afield in line with many
                        local and london wide initiatives including the Mayor of London’s Cultura at Risk team, HWFI Creative Enterprise Zone
                        (CEZ) and in collaboration with: Stour Space, London Metropolitan University, UCL, Loughborough University, Innovate UK
                        ,HWFI Community Development Trust (CDT) and a number of local partners and international committees. The project aims to
                        demonstrate new models of business, place-making and civic engagement, it will reflect and showcase community heritage,
                        culture and diversity, support the creation of approximately 20 new jobs, develop skills and encourage socio-economic
                        resilience through: capacity building, workshops, training and education, support the wellbeing of people through
                        community cohesion, civic engagement and empower people in their capacity as citizens to be active members of their

                        A photographer & videographer using visual media to connect & address social issues.
                        The main focus of my creative activities is based on visual media being photography & film . I have received a
                        MA degree
                        in Photography from Middlesex University. I have created 3 books, 2 of each have been focused on small artists
                        in need
                        of help.

                    <p>
                        1st one focused on the artist struggling to make it in the industry and having to support themselves via
                        hospitality
                        work. The project was based on portraying the artist trying to create their own work in the self made studios in
                        their
                        home.
                        2nd was a street project on buskers & street artist that choose to take their craft to the public rather then
                        being
                        constricted by venues, galleries and such.

                    <p>
                        Since the ending of my course in 2018 I have worked with a number of artists and organisations & became a member
                        of
                        several arts collectives.

                    <p>
                        On top of managing that site, I am personally working on a documentary for the organisation as well as offering
                        free
                        product photography and visual content for the artist involved to support then during those trying times.
