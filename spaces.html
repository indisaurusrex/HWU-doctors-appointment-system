                            <p>This area is designed to provide open plan work spaces which can be visible to the public such as jewelers or painters
                            showcasing their practice to the public as well as providing direct access to sales of their products through display
                            cabinets and wall space (green), the current commission charge for sales is set at 25% which shows exceptional value to
                            the maker. Until 2017 Stour Space operated a ‘SHOP’ in it’s premises selling the work of over 300 local artists
                            generating economic and marketing support and representation. The SHOP was forced to close through the impact of local
                            developments and since then there has been no similar support. Building on our past experience and longstanding
                            connections with the arts community the shop in this premises will continue to support recovery from covid over the next
                            year.</p>
                            <p>Through a curated process other makers in the area will be able to showcase their work for sale and exposure.</p>
                            <p>Residents will further be supported to give workshops through regular ‘training days’ where social distancing supports
                            this and will be trained in how to manage this to build their capacity.</p>
