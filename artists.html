                            Born in Tokyo, Japan in 1990, Emily Hana Johnson is a London based artist. Hana graduated from COFA (Sydney
                            Australia)
                            with a Bachelor of Art Education in 2013 majoring in drawing and painting, Minoring in printmaking; sculpture;
                            ceramics;
                            photography (analogue & digital); architecture-public art; outsider art (law) and metal casting (bronze).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hana predominantly works in the field of printmaking, drawing, sculpture and installation to explore the way that
                            light
                            interacts with objects almost as a three dimensional entity. Her focus is based around the connection of angular
                            tessellations, shadow, and light, and the way these aspects interrelate to change an audience's perception of an
                            object
                            or space.

                        <p>
                            We are Lamine and Mona, two plant-lovers living in Hackney Wick. During the lockdown, we realised how much living
                            surrounded by plants was making us feel good, and decided to use our love of plants, DIY and art to create Repot. We
                            took cuttings from plants we had at home and started propagating them.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our first plants were baby Aloe Vera and Tradescantia from well-grown mother plants. We started painting pots and
                            repotting them… Repot was born!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every pot has been designed and painted by ourselves, and delivered by walk or bike in Hackney Wick where our story
                            started.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since our launch in May, we did 6 collections and painted over 300 pots. Everything sold out, so we decided to carry
                            on!

                            DeMí (Gianluca DeMichele) born in Italy 1980, is a multidisciplinary visual artist, lyricist, music producer and
                            songwriter. Raised in Rome and Monopoli, Italy, his childhood is characterised by the frequent moving between the
                            ancient capital famous for its heritage, hometown of his father and the naturalistic and calming scenery of his
                            mother's
                            hometown in coastal Puglia.
                        </p>
                        <p>Frequent travel and growing up in these disparate settings as a child inform and inspire his
                            work, both past and in on-going projects. At the beginning of 2009 he moves to London, UK.
                        </p>
                        <p>Informed by academic background in Natural Sciences and Philosophy, his self-taught skills as a painter continued to
                            grow from his childhood
                            fascination in esoteric sciences, mysticism, alchemy and the spirit realms.
                        </p>
                        <p>An abstract self-portrait titled 'E Diurne
                            Notti' painted at the age of 17 marks the first questioning of the human experience on Earth, the dilemma of the
                            ego,
                            the wandering mind, the 'who am I' and 'where do I come from’.
