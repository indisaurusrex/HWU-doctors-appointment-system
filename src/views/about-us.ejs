                        Hackney Wick Underground is a grassroots nonprofit organisation. A live project that practices commons theory,
                        acknowledging the ideology as a valuable and inclusive means of governing space. We are as much a workspace as a
                        collective, exhibition space and a community, offering affordable studio space along with a host of open source
                        provisions at reasonable rates for the residents of Hackney Wick and Fish Island.

                        “Designing a collective workspace based on commons principles reintroduces collective orchestration while creating
                        opportunities for learning and knowledge sharing between community members. We are opening up right to use land for
                        community members to organise and learn together, these values are central to this business model.” <span class="no-italics">- Neil McDonald,
                        Director.</span>
