                            Stour Space (2009), the original project, still exists as an independent ecosystem of business and community and until
                            Covid-19 saw over 100,000 people a year attending its exhibitions and events from a diverse range of people providing
                            safe space, a true civic space, even hosting national and local election polls in it’s gallery. Over the last year Stour
                            has diversified its organisational structure giving birth to Stour Studios, Stour Galleries and Stour Cafe which operate
                            independently and in additional creative hubs, allowing greater reach and additional opportunities for empowerment.

                            Hackney Wick and Fish Island Community Development Trust (HWFI, CDT), was an evolution of Stour Space at an area wide
                            level which saw a consortium of local civic and cultural organisations come together to strategically influence the
                            development of the area of (HWFI) adjacent to the London 2012 Olympics.
                            In response to the tenuous nature of the area, the CDT positions itself as a (self declared and now authorityrecognised)
                            Hyper Local Authority, actively engaging with communities, authorities and developers. The CDT was a defining factor in
                            the area being designated as one of the first Mayor of London Creative Enterprise Zones with Civic State leading the
                            short/mid/long term Strategy in a practical way.

                            WICK CNC is a non-profit CNC micro-factory, using robotics to create among other things, sustainable modular buildings
                            (partnership with U-Build) that is zero waste, works of art, design and furniture, training and employment opportunities
                            to local people. The project takes advantage of the Mayor of London Good Growth funding of £50,000 in the purchase and
                            use of a CNC machine. The wider project however was underfunded and so Wick CNC was created to solve a problem whereby
                            as a not profit the org uses the machine to make a surplus, reinvesting it to fund the authority projects as well
                            contribute to resilience of the HWFI Creative Enterprise Zone, as well a complementing the resource base of Civic State.
